# yarep
An application to facilitate Q&amp;A sessions between representatives and the members of their constituencies.

**Stage 1: Registration, login and profile pages**

The first thing we need is a registration page.
It will be nice to have facebook, twitter and g+ logins after which the visitor is asked to select her state and LGA.
Then they will be sent to their profile page which shows the Senator and House of Reps member.

**Stage 2: Leaderboard**

When representatives register, we want to show them on this table to "sort-of" show the more progressive ones.
Then we can have a slogan: *Is your representative on board? Ask why not*

**Notes**
